## Remembot - Back End

#### Full-Stack Web App connected to Twilio API

React Web App (front-end UI) with Node/Express proxy server (back-end) connected to Twilio API.  Uses webhooks and AI to have "conversations" and set reminders about things to do.

## Purpose
Sends subscribers text reminders for things to do.  Twilio Autopilot will allow for "conversations" between user and bot.

-Bot will connect with Twilio API
-Bot will send a good morning reminder every morning at the same time
-Bot will determine a list of to-dos based on the day of the week
-Bot will text reminders at a pre-designated time
